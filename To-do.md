### To-do
 - Make it pipeline style with begin, process + end, so that import can happen in begin, and it can do thousands of lookups without having to import hashtable from CliXml for each lookup. The GUI version only loads once, then do instant lookups. CLi should do this aswell if multiple objects from pipeline.
 - Make a parameter to get vendor ID on local MAC or MAc of default GW? (even cooler.. MAC of all CDP/LLDP neighbours)
